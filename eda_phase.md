# What to do in EDA?

DONT FORGET TO DO THESE IN EDA!

* count NaN values for each feature
* get distribution of each feature
* get correlation with heatmap and annotate the value with annot = True (when using seaborn)
* check for correlation between predictors-predictors and predictors-target. features which are not correlated with target and feature which are correlated with each other are not good for regressions.
* boxplot features
* do some tests like ANOVA, MANOVA
